*********************

Max for the Visual Arts is a self-learning tool and a repository for the Max patches made or used on the BA interaction design arts (IDA) and the MA interactive design communication (IDC) at the London College of Communication (University of the Arts London, United Kingdom)

There are two releases of the patch, the complete version (available on request to educators) and the GIT version (https://github.com/imi/Max-for-the-Visual-Arts). The GIT is a light version where the externals, java, media and the applications folders are not included (some links in the patches will not work but you should be able to find them easily). 

Run the main patch _M4VA_help from the Extras menu. Also in the Extras menu, look in the _M4VA folder for various toolboxes. To install some of the externals we use (shell, dot, cv, ...), open the objects_download patch. 

The Max4VisualArts folder is located in the /Users/Shared/Max 7/Packages/Max4VisualArts. From version 2.50, the patches have been optimised to work with Max 7, most should work in Max 6 and some will work in Max 5 but they are no longer supported.

Minimum requirement: shell object (http://cycling74.com/toolbox/bernstein-shell/)

*********************

The patches starting with M4VA were made or improved by Nicolas Mar√©chal. Others were great solutions found on the http://cycling74.com/forums/ or borrowed from Max's evangelists Peter Elsea, Robert Ramirez, Andrew Benson, Luke DuBois and Sam Tarakajian, thanks for their great tutorials and support to the non tilda (!~) users.

Credits also goes to the students who have contributed to this project through their research, their project or simply a request for clarification.
