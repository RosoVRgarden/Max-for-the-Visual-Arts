*********************
Intro

Max for the Visual Arts is a self-learning tool and a repository for the Max patches used in interaction design and new media art.

Run the main patch _M4VA_help from the Extras menu. Also in the Extras menu, look in the _M4VA folder for various toolboxes. 

The Max4VisualArts package is located in the /Users/Shared/Max 7/Packages/. From version 2.50, the patches have been optimised to work with Max 7, most should work in Max 6 and some will work in Max 5 but they are no longer supported. 

Version 2.55 is the first version compatible with the new Package Manager in Max 7.
Version 2.60 has been tested with Max 8 and Max 9. 

*********************
Dependencies

This package heavily depends on the work of others. The first patch, m4va dependencies has links to the extensions, abstractions, patches and applications that we use. 

Please take the time to install those to avoid the frustration of non working patches. 

- The first group is currently available from the package manager (In Max, choose File then Show Package Manager). 

- In the essentials group, some will require that you create a package for them.
(see here: https://docs.cycling74.com/max7/vignettes/packages). 

- The applications group can be installed in the apps folder in the Max4Visual Arts package so the links to applicacations in the patches will work.

- The payware group contains one software (osculator) that is essential is you want to use the Wii reliably with Max. DmxusbPro is an extension to use the DMX protocol in your projects (they are some free solutions as well).

Finally, we use applescript / osascript on certain patches, make sure that is activated 
(https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202802)

*********************
Incompatibilities

We use these patches on a Mac, there might be incompatibilities on a PC. That is particularly true with some of the Applescripts that we use.
